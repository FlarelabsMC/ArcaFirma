# ArcaFirma
 A Minecraft modpack based around TerraFirmaCraft that aims to have many MMORPG aspects.

# Credits
GoryMoon and their mod You Died - their mod is cool, check it out! A lot of the code for this modpack's custom death screen was based on their mod, which is MIT license.
AzureDoom and AzureLib - a reliable fork of GeckoLib. There wouldn't be any custom mobs in this pack without it!
