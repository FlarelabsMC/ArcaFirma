#Define custom detection mechanics for mobs by tagging them as one of the following: 
#(a)ll-seeing mobs ignore FoV modifiers. 
#(c)heliceric mobs are not distracted by cobwebs. 
#(d)eaf mobs ignore sound cues. 
#(e)yeless mobs cannot be blinded. 
#(h)eat-seeking mobs ignore LoS modifiers. 
#(i)nstant mobs skip the search phase. 
#(k)lutzy mobs have effectively no stealth. 
#(l)azy mobs never look for you. 
#(m)indful mobs are treated as alert even when attacking entities other than you. 
#(n)octurnal mobs ignore light level. Despite what you may imagine, this will make sneaking upon them very hard, so tag in moderation. The retina system exists for a reason. 
#(o)bservant mobs ignore invisibility. 
#(p)erceptive mobs ignore motion multipliers. 
#(q)uiet mobs do not broadcast sound cues, even if they do make sounds. 
#(v)igilant mobs are treated as alert even without an attack or revenge target.
#(w)ary mobs ignore luck.
